# energy-optimization-platform
Scalable Energy Resource Optimization Platform built with Java Spring Boot, Angular, Docker, and Kubernetes. Simulates demand forecasting, resource scheduling, and cost optimization for energy transition projects.

A full-stack system designed to optimize **energy resource allocation and scheduling**.  
Built with **Spring Boot (backend)**, **Angular (frontend)**, and deployed using **Docker & Kubernetes** for scalability.  

This project simulates how energy providers can balance **production, consumption, and storage** to reduce costs and improve efficiency — directly aligned with the energy transition goals.
